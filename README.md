 Welcome to Git and GitHub at ChaiCode Cohort!                                  <p></p>

 <h2>Purpose of Documentation</h2>
    <p>
     The main purpose of this documentation is to provide proper knowledge about Git and github to new employees.
    </p>
    
  <h2>Why</h2>
   <p>The answer of why is because many employees are using GitHub to store their project. It is very useful because multiple people can work on the same project, even if they are not connected to a common server. Our companyâ€™s employees are work on github.</p>

   <h2>Basic about Git and Github</h2>
   <p>Git is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code of the projects. It is termed a distributed version control system because of its behaviour to allow multiple people to work on the same project, even if they are not connected to a common server.</p>
   
   <h1>Brief overview on git and github</h1>
   <p>Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is known for its speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git, making it easier to manage and collaborate on projects. GitHub was launched in 2008 and is maintained by Microsoft. It offers additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and user management, which are not available in Git1.
Key Differences Between Git and GitHub
1.	Nature: Git is a software tool, while GitHub is a service1.
2.	Interface: Git is primarily a command-line tool, whereas GitHub provides a graphical user interface1.
3.	Installation: Git is installed locally on your system, while GitHub is hosted on the web.
4.	Maintenance: Git is maintained by the Linux community, while GitHub is maintained by Microsoft.
5.	Focus: Git focuses on version control and code sharing, while GitHub focuses on centralized source code hosting.
